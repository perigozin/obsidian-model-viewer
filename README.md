Currently under development.

# Known issues:

- When scrolling away from the element and back to it sometimes the loaded model will disappear. Probably due to how Obsidian lazy loads the content of a note.

# Notes:

- Not tested on macOS and Linux. The way the filesystem is accessed probably needs to be altered depending on which system is used.
- The code needs refactoring/optimization.$ git branch -m master main
